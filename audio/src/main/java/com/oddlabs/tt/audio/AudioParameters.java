/**
 * Parameters used to configure the creation and playback of audio.
 *
 * @param audio The audio file to play.
 * @param rank Priority of the audio. Higher rank means it's less likely to be preempted when channels are
 *            exhausted.
 * @param distance The maximum distance at which the sound can be heard. Sounds beyond this distance are culled or
 *            muted.
 * @param gain The base volume multiplier (0.0 to 1.0+). Higher values increase the base volume.
 * @param radius The reference distance for attenuation. Sounds closer than this radius play at their maximum gain.
 *            Increasing this makes the sound seem larger or louder over a greater area.
 * @param pitch The playback speed/pitch multiplier (1.0 is normal).
 * @param looping True if the audio should loop continuously.
 * @param relative True if coordinates are relative to the listener, false for absolute world coordinates.
